The dataset used throughout the project includes six young healthy subjects who were asked to perform five variations of the biceps curl weightlifting exercise. One of the variations is the one predicted by the health professional.

The dataset was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, Weight Lifting Exercises monitored with Inertial Measurement Units: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/273/weight+lifting+exercises+monitored+with+inertial+measurement+units

## 📌 Objective

The purpose of this project is to classify biceps curl exercise variations using wearable sensor data collected from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers placed on a participant’s belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell using the application of machine learning and programing techniques.
